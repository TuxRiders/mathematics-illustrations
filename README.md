# Source codes of the "Engineering mathematics and simulation illustrations" videos

This repository contains the source codes of the animations in the ["Engineering mathematics and simulation illustrations"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6fjYEpJFi7V9eDVEWeeYCB-NXI8ieqct) series. The codes are developed using the [Manim community](https://www.manim.community/) package in Python.

After installing Manim, you can simply build and run the animations with this command:
```Shell
manim -pqh pde_animation.py PDE
```

or this one for producing a low quality video.
```Shell
manim -pql pde_animation.py PDE
```
